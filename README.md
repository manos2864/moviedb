I created this project for demonstration purpose and to practice my skills in react.

I use Bootstrap & React as frameworks.
I use as CSS pre-processor the SASS.
I have implement Redux for state management and react-router for routing.
For async tasks in the Redux i use Redux-thunk.
I use the restful API of themoviedb API to fetch details about the movies and the javascript library of axios to perform HTTP requests.
