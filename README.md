I created this project for demonstration purpose and to practice my skills in react.

-I use Bootstrap & React as frameworks.
-I use as CSS pre-processor the SASS.
-I have implement Redux for state management and react-router for routing.
-For async tasks in the Redux i use Redux-thunk.
-I use the restful API of themoviedb API to fetch details about the movies and the javascript library of axios to perform HTTP requests.
-I have create animations for buttons and illustrations with css vanilla transitions/animations. (I used Figma tool to edit the svgs and undraw.co to find them)
